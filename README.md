# User Manager

This repository was forked off the UserManager git from Bola Olajide (Andela Learning Community) as a submission for the ALC with Microsoft DevOps program

### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

### Installation
* Install Docker. (Docker For Windows 10 or Docker Toolbox for versions less than 10)
* Start up your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows OS).
* Ensure that you have 'node' installed on your PC.
* Clone the repository by entering the command 'git clone https://github.com/kcemenike/userManagerAndela' in the terminal.
* Run 'docker-compose up'

### Testing
To ensure that your installation is successful you'll need to run tests.
The command: `npm test` makes this possible. It isn't functional right now, but once it's done you'll be notified via the README.
